## BPFd: Running BCC tools remotely across systems and architectures

### Introduction

[BCC tools](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/README.md) are a suite of kernel tracing tools that allow systems engineers to efficiently and safely get a deep understanding into the inner workings of a Linux system. Because they can't crash the kernel, they are safer than kernel modules and are also can be used in production. [Brendan Gregg has written](http://www.brendangregg.com/ebpf.html) several nice tools, and talks in videos showing the full power of eBPF based tools.

In the Android kernel team, we work mostly on ARM64 systems. BCC tools support on ARM64 systems had been broken for years. Recently this got [fixed](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/1202) and one could run the tools but...

Inorder for BCC tools to work at all, they need kernel sources. This is because most tools need to register callbacks on the ever changing kernel API inorder to get their data. Such callbacks are registered using the [kprobe](https://lwn.net/Articles/132196/) infrastructure. Kernel sources are large in size and often can take up a large amount of space on the system being debugged. They can also get out of sync which may make the tools misbehave.

The other issue is Clang and LLVM libraries need to be available on the target being traced. This is because the tools compile the needed BPF bytecode which are then loaded into the kernel. These libraries take up a lot space. It seems overkill you need a full blown compiler infrastructure on a system when the BPF code can be compiled elsewhere and maybe even compiled just once. Further these libraries need to be cross-compiled to run on the architecture you're tracing. That's possible, but why would anyone want to do that if they didn't need to? Cross-compiling compiler toolchains can be tedious and stressful.

### BPFd: A daemon for BPF code and commands

Instead of loading up all the tools, compiler infrastructure and kernel sources onto the targets being traced, I decided to write a proxy program named BPFd that would receive commands and perform them on behalf of whoever is requesting them. The program would encapsulate all the needs of BCC and perform them - this includes loading a BPF program, creating, deleting and looking up maps, attaching a BPF program to a kprobe, polling for new data that the BPF may have written into a perf buffer etc.

#### Simple design
The design of BPFd is quite simple, it expects commands on `stdin` (standard input) and provides the results over `stdout` (standard output). Every command is only a single line always, no matter how big the command is. This allows easy testing using `cat`, since one could simply `cat` a file with commands, and parse whether the results are as expected. Results from a command however can be multiple lines.

For example, following is a command for creating a BPF map:
> BPF_CREATE_MAP 1 count 8 40 10240 0

With this simple design, its possible to write wrappers around `bpfd` to handle more powerful communication techniques like USB or Networking.
