# BPFd: Running BCC tools remotely across systems and architectures

## Introduction

[BCC tools](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/README.md) are a suite of kernel tracing tools that allow systems engineers to efficiently and safely get a deep understanding into the inner workings of a Linux system. Because they can't crash the kernel, they are safer than kernel modules and are also can be used in production. [Brendan Gregg has written](http://www.brendangregg.com/ebpf.html) several nice tools, and talks in videos showing the full power of eBPF based tools.

In the Android kernel team, we work mostly on ARM64 systems since most Android devices are on this architecture. BCC tools support on ARM64 systems had been broken for years. Recently this got [fixed](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/1202) and one could run the tools but..

Inorder for BCC tools to work at all, they need kernel sources. This is because most tools need to register callbacks on the ever changing kernel API inorder to get their data. Such callbacks are registered using the [kprobe](https://lwn.net/Articles/132196/) infrastructure. Kernel sources are large in size and often can take up a large amount of space on the system being debugged. They can also get out of sync which may make the tools misbehave.

The other issue is Clang and LLVM libraries need to be available on the target being traced. This is because the tools compile the needed BPF bytecode which are then loaded into the kernel. These libraries take up a lot space. It seems overkill you need a full blown compiler infrastructure on a system when the BPF code can be compiled elsewhere and maybe even compiled just once. Further these libraries need to be cross-compiled to run on the architecture you're tracing. That's possible, but why would anyone want to do that if they didn't need to? Cross-compiling compiler toolchains can be tedious and stressful.


## BPFd: A daemon for BPF code and commands
[Sources for BPFd can be downloaded here](https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd).

Instead of loading up all the tools, compiler infrastructure and kernel sources onto the targets being traced, I decided to write a proxy program named BPFd that would receive commands and perform them on behalf of whoever is requesting them. The program would encapsulate all the needs of BCC and perform them - this includes loading a BPF program, creating, deleting and looking up maps, attaching a BPF program to a kprobe, polling for new data that the BPF may have written into a perf buffer etc.

### Simple design
The design of BPFd is quite simple, it expects commands on `stdin` (standard input) and provides the results over `stdout` (standard output). Every command is only a single line always, no matter how big the command is. This allows easy testing using `cat`, since one could simply `cat` a file with commands, and parse whether the results are as expected. Results from a command however can be multiple lines.

For example, following is a command to BPFd for creating a BPF map:
> BPF_CREATE_MAP 1 count 8 40 10240 0

And the result from BPFd is:
> bpf_create_map: ret=3

The command tells BPFd to create a map named `count` with map type 1, with a key size of 6 bytes and a value size of 40, maximum of 10240 entries and no special flags. In return, BPFd created a map which is identified by file descriptor 3.

With the simple standard input/output design, its possible to write wrappers around `bpfd` to handle more advanced communication such as USB or Networking. In Android, we are going to be communicating these commands over the USB-based [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html).

### Changes to BCC tools

[Branch with latest changes to BCC tools](https://github.com/joelagnel/bcc/tree/bcc-bpfd)

A new `remotes` module has been added to BCC tools with an abstraction that different remote mechanisms should adhere to. This keeps code duplication to a minimum. Currently an `adb` remote and a `process` remote have been added.  The `adb` remote is for communication with the target device over USB or WiFi using the [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html). The `process` remote is for local testing. With this remote, bpfd is forked on the same machine running `bcc` and communicates with it over `stdin` and `stdout`.

BCC tools modifications involve the following changes:
- Adding support for remote communication with bpfd such as adb
- Changes to bcc to send commands to the remote system
- Making the kernel build more configurable so that kernel source and target architecture information can be passed through environment variables.
- Changes to tools to accomodate the differences
- Some bug fixes

### Example: Get it working with a Linux kernel running on a remote ARM64 system

This is just an example, it should be fairly straight forward to get these working for other remotes or architectures. For this example, we'll refer to the machine where you do all your development and have your kernel sources available as the `development machine` and the machine you're tracing as the `target`.

#### Install bcc tools on your development host
Follow the [steps here](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md) to get BCC tools installed on your development machine.

Except for the following changes:
- Build BCC [using this branch](https://github.com/joelagnel/bcc/tree/bcc-bpfd)
- Read the section "Build LLVM and Clang development libs" in that document. Unfortunately BPF inline-assembler support in LLVM is fairly recent, so you may need to build your own LLVM till then. Once LLVM is built, add `<path-to-llvm-source>/build/bin/` to your `$PATH` and then build BCC.

#### Install bpfd on your target host
This really depends on the target, typically you can store it anywere `$PATH` on the target can find it, in Android we store it in `/data/` for now. In the future we'd want to store it in /system/bin/ once its an official Android package.

#### Prepare your kernel sources
- Make sure the kernel sources are available on your development machine somewhere, and that the kernel build has completed atleast once in the kernel source directory.

#### Setup environment variables
The following environment variables need to be setup:
- `ARCH` should point to the architecture of the `target` such as `x86` or `arm64`.
- `BCC_KERNEL_SOURCE` should point to the kernel source directory.
- `BCC_REMOTE` should point to the remote mechanism such as `adb`.

Two example enviornment variable settings are provided which can be sourced. Here's one for [adb interface with an arm64 Android target](https://github.com/joelagnel/bcc/blob/bcc-bpfd/arm64-adb.rc) and another one for a [local x86 target with a process remote](https://github.com/joelagnel/bcc/blob/bcc-bpfd/x86-local.rc).
